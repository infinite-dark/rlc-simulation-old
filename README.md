# RLC Circuit Simulation

This is a simple educational project, Its purpose was to learn about, implement and visualize the 4th order Runge-Kutta method for solving a second order linear differential equation, using a practical example.

The code is very old (about two years). Basically - it's terrible. It's a complete and utter mess, and it should be (and will be) re-written.
