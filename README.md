# RLC Circuit Simulation

This is a simple educational project, Its purpose was to learn about, implement and visualize the 4th order Runge-Kutta method for solving a second order linear differential equation, using a practical example.

The code is very old (about two years). Basically - it's terrible. It's a complete and utter mess, and it should be (and will be) re-written.

Please note, while I strive to respect all legal obligations, I am not a legal expert and therefore I am unable to properly address the licensing and other legal issues potentially concerning this repo.

  - Author: The code present in this repository was written by me based on publicly available information and documentations.
  - Licensing: This project is open-source (I suppose?). The respective licenses of the used components apply (in whatever way the law says they should I guess? I dunno, don't ask me.). All jokes aside, respect the licenses!
  - Purpose: This project was made for my own, personal, educational use.

My intention for publishing this project on GitHub was purely technical - to share the code without resorting to manually adding project collaborators. The problem is that GitHub doesn't allow for "unlisted" repositories in the same way as, for example, YouTube allows for "unlisted" videos. I'm therefore forced to publish the repo even if I do not want to do that whatsoever (especially considering the legal issues).
